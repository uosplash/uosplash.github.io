What is Splash?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

UO Splash! brings local high school students to the University of Oregon for a full day of immersive, student-led classes. Our goal is to create unique and fun learning experiences for students, especially those from underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds.

Led by University of Oregon physics students, this initiative aims to cultivate a distinctive educational atmosphere that deviates from standard high school offerings, providing an in-depth dive into the many fascinating fields of physics. Students have the chance to delve into topics they might not typically encounter, empowering them to take charge of their learning journey.

In addition, we provide University of Oregon students with an opportunity to contribute to the community by sharing their passions and interests. As a Splash instructor, you have the freedom to choose any subject or activity that you are excited to share with other students. Whether it's a hands-on lab session, a dynamic lecture, or something in-between, the structure is entirely up to you.
